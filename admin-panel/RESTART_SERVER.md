# ⚠️ SERVER RESTART REQUIRED

The scheduled notification system has been fixed, but you need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.

## How to restart:

1. Stop the current server (press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
2. Start it again with: `node server.js`

## What was fixed:

1. **Time Reference Issue**: Fixed inconsistent time references that were causing scheduling logic to fail
2. **Threshold Reduced**: Changed from 30 seconds to 10 seconds minimum for scheduled notifications
3. **Better Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track scheduling decisions
4. **Consistent Time Handling**: Used single time reference throughout the request lifecycle

## Testing after restart:

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd admin-panel
node test-debug-time.js
```

This will test various scheduling times and show you which ones are scheduled vs sent immediately.

The expected behavior after the fix:
- Notifications scheduled >10 seconds in future → Status: "scheduled"
- Notifications scheduled ≤10 seconds in future → Status: "sent" (immediate)

## Monitoring scheduled notifications:

The server now logs detailed information every minute when the cron job runs:
- Total scheduled notifications in database
- Notifications ready to send
- Next scheduled notification time

Watch the server console to see this information.
